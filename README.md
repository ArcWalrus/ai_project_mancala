DISCLAIMER 1: This ReadMe assumes that the reader already understands the basic rules of Mancala.

This is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that plays a game of Mancala against a human player, written in Java. The AI (or CPU player) uses a MinMax algorithm in order to predict the best possible move against the human player. The human player's goal is to beat the AI player by claiming the most points. The human player is able to make a move by typing in the corresponding hole number that they want to take seeds from, the program does the rest of the work! 



DISCLAIMER 2: Do not be surprised if there are some minor bugs encountered.
